description:"There is more to life than just living. There has to be more to life than to just live. There should be a higher purpose in life. The purpose of life is to come to the real answer of ‘Who am I?’ This is the unanswered question of infinite previous lives. The missing links of the search for ‘Who am I?’ are now being provided through the words of the Gnani Purush (The One who is completely Self-Realized). These words are edited for the purpose of comprehension. Who am I? What am I not? Who is the Self? What is mine? What is not mine? What is bondage? What is Moksha (liberation)? Is there a God? What is God? Who is the ‘doer’ in the world? Is God the ‘doer’ or not? What is the real nature of God? What is the nature of the real ‘doer’ in this world? Who runs the world? How does it function? What is the real nature of illusion? Whatever one knows is it real or is it an illusion? Will one become free or remain bound with the knowledge one has? This book will give the precise understanding of the truth behind these questions.",

There are altogether 20 exercise questions spread in eight chapters of the book. One of them is an open-ended question and so the answer is not given. This book therefore contains 19 answers. Readers may treat these 19 answers as worked examples. They may find that Exercises Questions 4 and 5 of Chapter 3 and Exercise Question 2 of Chapter 4 are interesting and challenging. These are the author’s original work, and as far as the author knows readers will not find these in any other people’s works.",

Closely following the structure of the theory book, it shows how the examples in that book can be expressed in SQL. SQL’s many deviations from relational database theory are thus exposed and their consequences discussed. Drawing on the author’s long experience as a member of the committee responsible for production of the ISO SQL standard, the book includes copious Historical Notes showing how SQL has evolved from its very beginnings in the 1970s",

  description: "This is an academic textbook for a one-semester course in statistical physics at honours BSc level. It is in three parts and begins with a unified treatment of equilibrium systems, based on the concept of the statistical ensemble, in which the usual combinatorial calculation only has to be worked out once. In the second part, it deals with strongly interacting systems in terms of many-body theory, including the virial expansion and critical phenomena at the level of mean-field theory. The third, and last, part of the book is concerned with time-dependence; and, it begins with a classical treatment of the paradox posed by the `arrow of time'. This is the question of why macroscopic systems are irreversible when their constituent microscopic interactions are reversible in time. It then treats the derivation of transport equations, linear response theory, and quantum dynamics. Throughout the book, the emphasis is on a clear, concise exposition, with all steps being clearly explained.",

  {title: 'Sustainable Food Systems',

  description: "Faced with a global threat to food security, it is perfectly possible that society will respond, not by a dystopian disintegration, but rather by reasserting co-operative traditions. This book, by a leading expert in urban agriculture, offers a genuine solution to today’s global food crisis. By contributing more to feeding themselves, cities can allow breathing space for the rural sector to convert to more organic sustainable approaches.Biel’s approach connects with current debates about agroecology and food sovereignty, asks key questions, and proposes lines of future research. He suggests that today’s food insecurity – manifested in a regime of wildly fluctuating prices – reflects not just temporary stresses in the existing mode of production, but more profoundly the troubled process of generating a new one. He argues that the solution cannot be implemented at a merely technical or political level: the force of change can only be driven by the kind of social movements which are now daring to challenge the existing unsustainable order.",
